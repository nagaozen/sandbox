# Windows

aiod on Windows is the same binary with the same API: auth, the response envelope, and OpenAPI are unchanged. This page covers only what differs from Linux, verified on Windows Server 2022 with Windows PowerShell 5.1.

## Differences from Linux

| Area | Linux | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell for commands (`/v2/commands`) | `bash`, `sh` | `powershell` (default), `cmd`, `bash` |
| Terminal sessions (PTY) | Native PTY or tmux | ConPTY on PowerShell |
| `exec` on a terminal session | Works on any shell | `501`; use `/v2/commands` |
| `user` request field | Switches execution identity | Not implemented |
| Process model | One process, own supervisor | `aiod.exe` as a process or Session 0 service |
| `permissions` in file metadata | Octal mode (`644`) | `readwrite` or `readonly` |
| File attributes | POSIX permissions | Hidden/System → `is_hidden: true` |
| Runtime state | `/run` or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | `%TEMP%\aiod-0\<hash>`, nothing durable |

Each PTY session runs inside a Job Object. An explicit `user` answers `400`; a configured `AIO_DEFAULT_USER` answers `503`.

Package queries work on Windows too: pip via the resolved Python, npm via its `.cmd` shim. The Node.js listing works under a service as well — a service account has no `APPDATA` and so no per-user global prefix, so npm is pointed at the Node install's own directory, where a machine-wide install keeps its global packages.

The runtime directory is per user; `--runtime-dir` (or `AIO_RUNTIME_DIR`) moves it. For a service, `%TEMP%` is `C:\Windows\Temp`.

## Commands

### Shells

| `shell` | Windows |
| --- | --- |
| `auto`, `powershell` | `pwsh`, falling back to `powershell` |
| `cmd` | `%ComSpec%`; UTF-8 output, no prompt echo |
| `bash` | Git Bash (resolution order below) |
| `sh` | `503`; there is no POSIX `sh` |
| `none` | The command must resolve as an executable |

`bash` resolution never involves WSL: it checks `AIO_BASH_BIN`, then a `bash` on `PATH` that is not `System32\bash.exe`, then a Git install under `%ProgramFiles%` or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%`. With `none` there is no shell, so a builtin such as `echo` fails to spawn. A PowerShell script longer than 8191 bytes, and every `cmd` script, is written under the runtime directory and run from there; the file is left behind, so a failed script stays inspectable.

### Exit codes

The last statement decides. `$?` true → 0. `$?` false → the last native program's exit code when it is nonzero, else 1. A native failure earlier in the script does not leak into a successful ending: `cmd /c exit 3; Write-Output ok` exits 0, as `bash -c` would. `exit N` and `Set-StrictMode` behave as in a script file.

Exit codes are the raw process value, not reduced modulo 256: `exit 300` reports 300 and `exit -1` reports -1.

The daemon appends its exit trailer to the script. A script that ends in a dangling `|` continues its pipeline into the trailer, so PowerShell reports the syntax error at the trailer's line. The exit code is still 1.

### Kill and timeout

| Signal | Windows mapping | Guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SIGKILL`, `hard_timeout` | Job Object termination | The whole tree is gone, grandchildren included |
| `SIGTERM` (default), `SIGINT` | Cooperative `taskkill /T` | None (best effort) |

A killed or timed-out command reports `exit_code: -1`, with `status: "timed_out"` after `hard_timeout`. Cooperative signals are best effort: the route answers `200` whether the process acts on them or not. Follow one with `SIGKILL` when the command has to stop.

### Output, environment, stdin, cwd

- **Line endings** — stdout and stderr keep what the child wrote: PowerShell and cmd write CRLF, Git Bash writes LF. Output is UTF-8 on every shell; offsets count bytes.
- **Empty `env` value** — `env: {"KEY": ""}` unsets the variable. PowerShell removes a variable assigned the empty string, and a Windows environment block cannot hold an empty value. Values with quotes or newlines survive.
- **stdin** — PowerShell runs with `-NonInteractive`, so `Read-Host`, `Get-Credential`, and other prompts fail at once. Data written to `/v2/commands/{id}/stdin` reaches `[Console]::In.ReadLine()` and native programs.
- **Relative `cwd`** — Resolves against the daemon process's working directory, as on Linux. Under a service that directory is a system location, so a relative `cwd` normally answers `400 Working directory does not exist`. Forward slashes are accepted.

## Files

### Paths

Paths are used as given, without normalisation: a relative path resolves against the daemon's working directory, `..` is honoured, and `C:/dir` and `c:\dir` both work and are echoed back as sent. A driveless `\name` means the current drive's root, so an upload `path` of `\aiod.exe` lands at `C:\aiod.exe`. Send full paths.

### Permissions and hidden files

`permissions` is `readwrite` or `readonly`, from the file's read-only attribute. A directory is always `readwrite`: Windows sets the attribute on customised folders such as Desktop without it meaning anything for access.

`list` sets `is_hidden` from the Hidden attribute and from dot-prefixed names. `search`, `glob`, and `grep` skip dot-prefixed names only, so attribute-hidden files appear in their results. A `\` in a glob is a path separator on Windows.

### Error statuses

Windows error codes do not map onto the Unix errno table, so the same mistake can answer differently:

| Case | Windows | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path does not exist | `404` | `404` |
| Target already exists | `409` | `409` |
| Read through a file as if it were a directory | `404` | `400` |
| Write onto a directory | `403` | `400` |

### CRLF in read and edit

A full `read` returns the bytes verbatim. A line-range `read` keeps each line's CRLF and drops only the last line's terminator. `str_replace` matches bytes, so `old_str` must contain `\r\n` where the file does; a `\n` anchor answers `400 old_str not found in file`. `insert` writes new lines with the file's own ending.

### Watch files

A recursive watch is one native watch on the root, so directories under it can be renamed and deleted while watched. Events carry `relative_path` with `\` separators, `inode` is `null`, and a rename arrives as one `rename` for the old name and one for the new name.

## Terminal

`/v2/pty` and `/v1/shell` run PowerShell over ConPTY. `create`, `input`, `screen`, resize, the WebSocket attach, and close all work; `screen` returns the raw VT stream. `exec` answers `501` because its protocol needs a POSIX shell; use `/v2/commands`. `/v1/capabilities` reports `exec.pty: false` for that reason. `signal` closes the session, on every platform.

## Browser

The daemon only probes CDP; it never launches a browser. Start Chrome or Edge with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`; aiod picks it up the same way it does on Linux.

Forwarding `/cdp/*` to a public path is the deployment's job. The reverse proxy in front of the host does this, not the daemon.

`GET /v1/capabilities` probes for real on Windows too: `browser.process` via `tasklist`, CDP via `GET /json/version`.

## Desktop (computer-use)

Input aimed at the secure desktop is refused with `403`, and `data` names the reason. This includes a UAC prompt and the lock screen:

```json
{
  "status": "denied",
  "reason": "secure-desktop-or-uipi"
}
```

This is the rule that forces computer-use into its own process. A Session 0 service has no desktop, so a worker started there would refuse every action; computer-use has to run in the interactive logon session. aiod itself needs no desktop and can run as a service. The capabilities section of `GET /v2/sandbox` reports what the current session actually probed.

## Register aiod as a service

You can register aiod as a Windows service, configure automatic restarts, and open its port in the firewall. Run these commands as an administrator:

```powershell
$exe = "C:\Program Files\aiod\aiod.exe"
sc.exe create aiod binPath= "`"$exe`" service-run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 18091" start= auto obj= LocalSystem
sc.exe failure aiod reset= 86400 actions= restart/5000/restart/5000/restart/30000
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "aiod 18091" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 18091 -Action Allow
sc.exe start aiod
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:18091/health
```

`--port` sets the listening port. `sc.exe failure` configures automatic restarts: up to three restarts after a crash, then a 30 s gap; the counter resets daily.

A service has no console window. Logs go to `%ProgramData%\aiod\logs\aiod.log` by default; override the path with `AIO_SERVICE_LOG_FILE`.

### Defender

Exclude the installation directory and the runtime directory from real-time protection, and keep protection on for everything else. A workload command line can match Defender's machine-learning models; the remediation then terminates every process running the binary and quarantines the file, so every daemon on the host disappears at once. `Get-MpThreatDetection` shows the detection.

## Running computer-use

computer-use has to start inside the interactive logon session, so a logon-triggered, interactive scheduled task is the usual home for it. The repository's `scripts/windows/install-computer-use.ps1` registers one and waits for the worker's `/healthz`; re-running it with a new `-ExeSource` swaps the binary.

The ffmpeg directory is resolved from the machine `PATH`. It is injected into the task environment explicitly. A logon session's environment is snapshotted at logon; a later `PATH` edit is invisible to the task.

Screenshot and recording both need ffmpeg (gdigrab). If `where ffmpeg` finds nothing although `PATH` lists the directory, check the ACL. The task account needs read and execute on the ffmpeg directory.

## Verify

Run these in PowerShell against the port aiod listens on; `curl.exe` avoids the PowerShell `curl` alias:

```powershell
$BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:18091"
curl.exe "$BASE_URL/health"
curl.exe "$BASE_URL/v2/sandbox"
curl.exe -X POST "$BASE_URL/v2/commands" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command":"Get-Date"}'
```
