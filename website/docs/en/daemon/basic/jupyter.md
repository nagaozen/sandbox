# Jupyter

`/v1/jupyter` runs Python in a real IPython kernel. It covers what the native Python REPL cannot, at the cost of a heavier process:

- Rich output (`display_data` mime bundles, such as matplotlib PNGs)
- IPython magics
- A choice of installed Python versions

`aiod` implements this itself: it spawns `ipykernel` and speaks the Jupyter kernel protocol to it directly. No Jupyter server is involved, and nothing else needs to run.

## What it needs

The Python interpreter `aiod` selects must import `ipykernel` (`pip install ipykernel`). The daemon probes this once and keeps the result for its lifetime, so install `ipykernel` before starting the daemon. After installation, `GET /v1/capabilities` reports `code_interpreter.jupyter_backend: "kernel"` and lists `python_kernels`.

Without it, the `/v1/jupyter/*` routes are unavailable and explain how to fix the issue; `/v1/code/info` also does not advertise a `jupyter` kind.

If `AIO_JUPYTER_ENDPOINT` is set and reachable, the external Jupyter server takes precedence over the embedded kernel, and the daemon proxies `/v1/jupyter` to it as is.

## Run a cell

Post the cell source and read the notebook outputs from the response:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/jupyter/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "from IPython.display import HTML\nHTML(\"<b>hi</b>\")"}'
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "code": "from IPython.display import HTML\nHTML(\"<b>hi</b>\")"
}
```

`data` is:

- `code` — the code that ran
- `status` — `ok`, `error`, or `timeout`
- `execution_count` — the kernel's cell counter
- `outputs` — notebook output objects (`stream`, `execute_result`, `display_data`, `error`)
- `session_id` — the session that ran it; `null` for a one-off
- `kernel_name` — the kernel that ran it
- `msg_id` — the Jupyter message id of the request

Every key is present on every output object, `null` where it does not apply, so a client can read `outputs[i].text` or `outputs[i].data` without branching on the type first.

The body takes these fields:

| Field | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | required | Cell source; an empty one runs and answers `ok` |
| `session_id` | optional | Continues in the same namespace when reused |
| `stateful` | `true` | Returns a session id when true |
| `kernel_name` | one of `available_kernels`, default first | Which installed kernel runs the cell |
| `timeout` | 1–900 s (default 30) | A cell that exceeds it is interrupted |
| `cwd` | optional | Fixed at kernel start; a new value starts a new kernel |

A `kernel_name` this daemon does not support is a `422`: `unknown kernel 'ir'; available: python3, python3.14`. A `cwd` that is not a directory is not a rejection — the cell returns `200` with `success: false` and a `DirectoryError` output naming the path.

## Kernel info

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/v1/jupyter/info"
```

`available_kernels` is probed, not declared: every name in it is one a request may pass as `kernel_name`. The reply also carries a `description` and a `kernel_detection` line for a human reading the raw JSON.

## What comes back

An output object is one of four shapes:

| `output_type` | Carries | Produced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` | `name` (`stdout` or `stderr`) and `text` | `print`, and magics such as `%time` |
| `execute_result` | A `data` mime bundle and `execution_count` | The cell's last expression |
| `display_data` | A `data` mime bundle, `image/png` included | `display()`, and `%matplotlib inline` figures |
| `error` | `ename`, `evalue`, `traceback` | A raised exception; `status` becomes `error` |

Matplotlib needs `%matplotlib inline` for the PNG: with a plain `Agg` backend the figure goes to a file and the cell returns no `display_data`.

```python
client = Sandbox(base_url=BASE_URL)

# 1. Open a session and load the data in it.
client.jupyter.execute_code(
    session_id="report",
    code="import pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'v': [120, 135, 150]})",
)

# 2. A chart comes back as a PNG in display_data.
run = client.jupyter.execute_code(
    session_id="report",
    code="%matplotlib inline\ndf.plot()",
    timeout=120,
).data
for out in run.outputs:
    print(out.output_type, sorted((out.data or {}).keys()))

# 3. End the session; its kernel goes with it.
client.jupyter.delete_session("report")
```

`image/png` is base64, about 27 KB for that plot. A file the cell writes instead is an ordinary file: read it back through the [file plane](/daemon/basic/file).

## One-off or session

Without `session_id` or `stateful: true`, the cell is a one-off. It runs on a kernel taken from the warm pool, or spawned for the request; that kernel is terminated afterwards, so a name defined by one one-off is a `NameError` in the next.

Send `stateful: true` to receive a generated session id, or name your own `session_id`: either way the next call carrying that id continues in the same namespace. A session owns one kernel for its whole life, and `execution_count` keeps counting across its calls.

| Route | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/jupyter/sessions/create` | Open one up front | Takes `kernel_name`, `cwd`, `session_id` |
| `GET /v1/jupyter/sessions` | List them | Each entry has `kernel_name`, `cwd`, `state` |
| `GET /v1/jupyter/sessions/{id}` | Read one | An unknown id is a `404` |
| `DELETE /v1/jupyter/sessions/{id}` | End one | An unknown id is a `200` with `success: false` |
| `DELETE /v1/jupyter/sessions` | End all of them | Answers `cleaned_sessions` |

There is no session interrupt or restart: a cell past its `timeout` is interrupted on its own, and `DELETE` is how a session ends. Those two paths answer `501` saying so.

The session table is keyed by kernel and id together, so `s1` on the default kernel and `s1` on another are two namespaces; the second is listed under the composite key `python3.14:s1`. Where this kernel also serves the [Code](/daemon/basic/code) route, the same id there reaches the session's namespace.

A kernel's working directory is fixed when it starts. A request whose `cwd` differs from every pooled kernel's starts a new kernel; pooled kernels are never moved.

## Timeouts and limits

When a cell exceeds its `timeout`, the daemon sends `interrupt_request` on the control channel. It waits 2 s, then terminates the kernel. A kernel that stops in time keeps its session, and the cell reports `status: "timeout"` — a `KeyboardInterrupt` output, then `execution timed out after 2000ms and was interrupted`.

A kernel that ignores the interrupt is terminated and its session is dropped.

Output is capped at 2,000,000 characters per cell. A stream that crosses the cap keeps its head, a `stderr` stream carrying `[output truncated at 2000000 characters]` follows, and the cell's later outputs still arrive, within a further 64 KiB. Only stream text can be cut that way: a single result or image over the cap is dropped whole, leaving the note by itself.

| | Default | Variable |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent sessions | 5 | `AIO_KERNEL_MAX_SESSIONS` |
| Idle timeout | 300 s | `AIO_KERNEL_SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECS` |
| Warm kernels | 0 | `AIO_KERNEL_PREWARM` |

A sixth request answers `429` with `Maximum number of kernel sessions (5) reached`. Existing sessions are never evicted.

A kernel holds about 60 MB of memory. These limits are tighter than the native REPL's 20 sessions and 1800 s.

With a warm pool, the first cell after boot answers in about 90 ms instead of 1.4 s. The pool fills at boot and refills in the background after each use.

## Memory usage

Same limits (0.5 CPU, 0.5 GiB) for `aiod` and the 1.x image: `aiod` runs nginx and one warm kernel, the 1.x image has Jupyter on and browser/VNC off.

The kernel itself is similar in size; the difference is the surrounding services. Idle, `aiod` uses 69.8 MB and the 1.x image 248.4 MB.
